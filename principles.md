## if you commit to review code, review it thoroughly!

  Expect to spend a decent amount time on this. Be sure to read the code, don't just skim it, and apply thought to both the code and its style.

## Aim to understand every changed line!

 When you're done, you should be able to answer two following questions for yourself:	
 -  "What goal does this code accomplish?â€œ
 -  "How does it accomplish this goal?"

 ## Don't assume the code works - build and test it yourself! 

 You should actually pull down the code and test it out.

 ## Commenting matters! 
Complex logical statement should have a comment describing the programmer's intention for it.

## Review temporary code as strictly as production code. 
We should hold all code to the same standards and expectations.

## Consider how the code will work in production. 
If the code was shipped to end-users on the next commit, it may be functionally incomplete, but it should NOT be broken.

## Check documentation, tests, and build files. 
Good code doesn't just include code, it includes all of the trappings that go with it.

 ## Keep priorities straight when making suggestions. 
 1. Functional first,
 2. Clean and maintainable second, and
 3. Optimised third.

## Follow up on reviews. 
After suggesting changes, you should be prepared to review it again. Ensure the necessary changes were made, and any problems you found were reasonably resolved.

## Reviewers are not perfect! 
If you are not familiar with the code or concepts, you may want to request that an additional reviewer provide feedback, but don't shy away from doing the review yourself! Ultimately, four eyes are always better than two.
## #BONUS
A code review with ego attached is far worse than no review at all.
If you go in with the intent to show your brilliance, tear down another coder, or otherwise beat them over the head with your experience, do everyone a favor and don't bother reviewing the code at all.
